One of our recent events was the spring Court of Honor. Court of Honor is an exciting event because it is where the scouts from the troop receive their new ranks and badges. At the Spring 2025 Court of Honor the following scouts earned ranks:

* 1 scout reached Eagle Scout rank: Evan
* 2 for Life Scout rank: Julia and Jack
* 4 for Star Scout rank: Cathrine, Olivia, Moe, and Owen.
* 2 for First Class Scout rank: Beatrice and Iselin
* 4 for Second Class Scout rank: Chase, Xavier, Nicholas, and Abagail
* 2 for Tenderfoot Scout rank: Elliot and Sam
* 8 for Scout rank: Mina, Filomena, Aya, Logan, Grant, Henry, Bethany, and Adam

Evan was also celebrated at his own Eagle Scout Court of Honor. The next Troop Court of Honor will be in the fall, where we are sure that more scouts will have their hard work celebrated!
