## Pre-camp

Pre-camp this year was a memorable one. We drove eight hours to [Round Lake State Park](https://parksandrecreation.idaho.gov/parks/round-lake/). But on the way one of the wheels on our closed trailer blew out. That delayed our trip by about an hour. Everyone was ready to get to the campsite, and thankfully we didn't face any more challenges.

On the first day of Pre-camp we headed to the [Silverwood theme park](https://www.silverwoodthemepark.com/). We all rode the [Tremors roller coaster](https://www.silverwoodthemepark.com/rides/tremors.php) together. After riding roller coasters and playing in the water park we met for dinner where we had a very good buffet. Afterwards we rode a few more roller costers and then headed back to the campsite.

On the second day of pre-camp we packed up and drove to the [Bitterroot Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitterroot_Mountains) for a 13 mile bike ride through tunnels and over trestles on the historic [Route of the Hiawatha](https://www.ridethehiawatha.com/) railway. The tunnels were cold and muddy, and the bikes made us feel like we were mules pulling 5 pounds of mud! Afterwards we headed for Camp Eston. We were exhausted.

## Summer Camp at Camp Easton

Monday, Tusday, Thursday, and Friday were regular summer camp days full of Merit Badge classes and free time to enjoy camp. Tusday and Thursday morning we also had the Polar Plunge, a troop-wide swim at 6:30 am. But Wednesday was a day to remember. Wednesday was Banana Games. Banana Games involved each patrol taking a banana and doing crazy things with it, like carving it, swimming with it, and throwing it in the lake. Afterwards, Bill and Jen (our troop leaders) had to eat the bananas. They cheated, however, eating them with chocolate syrup. After eating bananas, Bill and Jen did the "Scout Master Belly Flop" out on the lake.

On Saturday we packed up to leave. Our trip back home started out smooth, but then one of the weels on the closed trailer went flat again. After repairing the tire we continued onto our troop base at St. Andrews church. There we cleaned all the troop gear to finish our summer camp adventure.
