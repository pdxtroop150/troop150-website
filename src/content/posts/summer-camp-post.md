## Pre-camp

Precamp this year was a memerble one. At the start,we had to drive 8 hours to the camp space. But when we had a brake for lunch we found out the one of the weels on the closed trailer had gotten shreted. That held back our drive by about an hour. But when we finaly got back on the road, everyone was ready to get to the campsite.

The first day of Pre-camp, we headed to the Silvortan amusment park. When we got there, we all road the Tremours Roller Coster. A little bit later we had lunch which was a make your own sandwitch bar. Then we went back to riding the roller costers and playing in the water park. When we all met for dinner, where we had a very good buffa. After that, we all did a few more roller costers, until heading back to the camp sight.

The seconed and last day of Pre-camp,we packed up, and went to go on a 15 mile bike ride. Over all it was fun and hot, the tunnels were cold and muddy, and the bikes made us feel like we were mules pulling 5 pounds of mud. When we got to the end, the line for the shuddle bus was about an hour long, but in the hot sun it felt like a day and 8 hours. After the bike ride we headed strait for Camp Eston. But even though it was only an hour, we were so egsosted it felt like for ever.

## Camp Eston: Summer Camp

Monday, Tusday, Thursday, and Friday were any regulor days at camp, Meirtbage Classes and freetime. Well, Tusday and Thursday we had the *Polar Plunge. But Wendsday was the day to remember. On Wendsday, we had to Banana Games. The Banana Games are when you take a banana and do all this crazy stuff with them, like carving it, swimming with it, and throwing it in the lake. After we did the stuff to the banana, Bill and Gen (our troop leaders) ate the banana. But they did cheat, they ate it with chocolate syrup. After they ate the banana, they did the "Scout Master Belly Flop". That was are day on Wendsday.

On Saterday, we all got ready to leave. When we left it was going pretty smooth but one of the weels on the closed trail had gone flat. After that surprise, we all stopped to get lunch. After lunch we countinued to the church. There we helped clean up and ended our"Summer Camp Adventure".
