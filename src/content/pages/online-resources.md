We use a bunch of online resources to help our scouts and their families stay informed and organize activities.

### Troop Website
This website is a great resource for all things Troop 150. You can find information about upcoming events, troop meetings, and resources for Scouts and parents.

### Quick Glance Calendar
You can find information on upcoming events at the website's [calendar page](/calendar). This calendar pulls from the official Troop 150 calendar in Scoutbook, providing a quick way to check upcoming events.

**Note:** See below on how to access the Troop 150 calendar in Scoutbook to RSVP for events.

### Packing Lists
When going on a camping trip, it's important to pack the right gear. You can find a packing list for camping trips on the [Gear page](/gear).

### my.Scouting
[my.scouting.org](https://my.scouting.org/) is the official Scouting America registration portal. It is where scouts, parents, and adult leaders manage their personal registrations and [Youth Protection Training](https://www.scouting.org/training/youth-protection/) records.

### Scoutbook
[Scoutbook](https://scoutbook.scouting.org/) is the official Scouting America platform for:

* Checking scout advancement requirement completion (both rank and merit badges)
* RSVPing for events
* Registering to start a Merit Badge under a Merit Badge Counselor (which gives the counselor access to update your progress)

Both parents and scouts can have their own Scoutbook accounts. Parents will be able to access their scout's information via Scoutbook account *links*. We also recommend creating accounts for scouts so they can manage their records if they have a personal email address. It's okay, though, for parents of younger scouts to manage their scout's records through parent accounts alone.

> If you have yet to create a Scoutbook account, please follow the instructions on our [New Scout Information](/new-scout-information#scoutbook) page.

#### Scoutbook vs Scoutbook Plus vs Scoutbook App
Scouting America is in the process of renovating Scoutbook. You may be asked to log in to Scoutbook or Scoutbook Plus to access different features, and the two interfaces look different. However, they are part of the same system and use the same logins.

You can also download the Scoutbook app for iOS or Android to access Scoutbook on your phone. You may find this easier to use than the website on your phone, but the functionality is the same as using the website on your phone.

### Merit Badges
Merit badges are a great way to learn new skills and earn recognition in Scouting. Later ranks in Scouting require completion of merit badges, but scouts of any rank can earn merit badges.

Each merit badge teaches a specific skill or knowledge area. You can find an overview of available merit badges at the Scouting America [Merit Badge page](https://www.scouting.org/skills/merit-badges/). Details on each merit badge, including requirements and resources, can be found in that badge's "pamphlet". Select a merit badge from the list on the Scouting America website, then find the link to "Download the Free Pamphlet" in the middle of the page.

Each merit badge must be completed with a Merit Badge Counselor, who will teach the required skills and evaluate your progress. You can find a list of Troop 150's Merit Badge Counselors on the [Merit Badge Counselors](/merit-badge-counselors) page. If there is no merit badge counselor for a merit badge you want to earn, please contact the Advancement Coordinator (or any [troop leader](/leaders)) to request a counselor for that merit badge. We can help you find a counselor, including counselors from nearby troops.
