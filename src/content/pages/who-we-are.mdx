### Philosophy

Troop 150 / 5150 is an active troop of 50+ boys and girls in Portland, OR. Our Troop philosophy is ‘Creating Life Experiences’:
* We don’t focus on any one kind of outing; we try different types of outings and experiences.
* Whether it is French-themed cooking on a bike trip, or backpacking into summer camp, we are always
looking to take an idea for an event and add a little Troop 150 flair.
* We are proud to have a successful Eagle program, but we also feel that the Eagle rank can be achieved without
having to focus solely on advancement.
* We are a youth-led troop and feel that scouts don’t learn to lead unless they are allowed to lead, experiencing
both challenges and successes.
* We believe in fully integrated patrols where scouts learn best when they learn from older scouts and
teach younger scouts in turn.
* We are firm believers in the “Class A” uniform. It creates a great team atmosphere and looks sharp when troop
members are assembled.
* Service to others is a key portion of Troop’s program; helping the church where we meet as well as out in the
community at large.
* We enjoy demonstrating our skills at the District Camporee and enjoy competing.
* We value athletics and enjoy competing in team sports and relay races as a Troop. Many of our scouts
compete in one or more team sports outside of Scouting as well!
