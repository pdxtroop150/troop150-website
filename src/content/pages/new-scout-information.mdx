Congrats! You're a new member of Troop 150! This page is designed to help you begin your Scouting journey. Below, you'll find important information about how to register and access online resources.

## my.Scouting
[my.scouting.org](https://my.scouting.org/) is the official Scouting America registration portal. It is where scouts, parents, and adult leaders manage their personal registration and [Youth Protection Training](https://www.scouting.org/training/youth-protection/) records.

If you were in a Cub Scout pack or another troop, then you should already have a my.scouting.org account.

If you are new to Scouting, then you will need to create an account. The easiest way to create an account and associate with Troop 150/5150 is to use one of the links on our [Join page](/join).

## Scoutbook
[Scoutbook](https://scoutbook.scouting.org/) is the online platform we use to track scout advancement, organize events, and manage merit badges.

<blockquote className="text-sm">Note: Scoutbook is provided by Scouting America for troop organizing purposes. It is separate from the [my.scouting.org](https://my.scouting.org/) registration system, but you must have a [my.scouting.org](https://my.scouting.org/) account to use Scoutbook.</blockquote>

You likely already have a Scoutbook account if you were a scout in a Cub Scout pack or another troop. We will link your Scoutbook account to Troop 150/5150 if you let us know that you are transferring from another troop or pack. Please contact the Advancement Coordinator (or any other [troop leader](/leaders)) to do so.

If need to create a Scoutbook account, first make sure you have a [my.Scouting](#myscouting) account.
    
Next, go to [Scoutbook](https://scoutbook.scouting.org/) and click on "Sign Up" in the top right corner. Fill out the form on the Sign Up page with your information.

Both parents and scouts can have their own Scoutbook accounts. Parents will be able to access their scout's information via Scoutbook account links. We also recommend creating accounts for scouts so they can manage their records if they have a personal email address. It's okay, though, for parents of younger scouts to manage their scout's records through parent accounts.

## Online Resources
Getting registered for scouting and Scoutbook is just the first step. We also use a variety of online resources to help our scouts and their families stay informed and organized. Please continue on to review these resources on our [Online Resources](/online-resources) page.
