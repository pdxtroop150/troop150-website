# Notes from Monday July 15th, 2024

## Two changes merged this week!
* Elliot's partially complete History page is merged (we're waiting on adult leaders to provide a brief Troop 150 history blurb)
* Elliot changed the button color to be a scouting green and the headings to be centered (both his ideas for styling that we're playing with)

## Leadership page
We welcomed Ian back to our team after a few weeks off! He started work on a new page to list the troop leadership.
