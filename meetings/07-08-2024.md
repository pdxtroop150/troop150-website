# Notes from Monday July 8th, 2024

## More work on the first two pages
Iselin figured out how to make tables, and is refactoring the merit badge counselor information by badge rather than by counselor name. This will make it easier for readers to find counselors for badges they want to achieve. This is a wonderful improvement Iselin came up with as she working on the page!

Elliot expanded the page he's working on to include the history of both BSA and the troop. We need some help fleshing out the troop history, though. Chase will send out an email to the adult leaders to get a brief history paragraph or two. Elliot also added links (for both girl and boy troops) so prospective scouts can join! The new page is almost ready to merge (see pdxtroop150/troop150-website#9).
