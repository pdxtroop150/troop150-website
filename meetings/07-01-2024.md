# Notes from Monday July 1st, 2024

## First week of actually working on the website!
This week Iselin, Stuart, and Elliot took on individual tasks to begin improving the website:

* Stuart created a favicon (the tiny image that shows up in browser tabs) using a BSA logo (see pdxtroop150/troop150-website#8).
* Elliot began working on a page about the history of scouting and the troop that we'll likely use to encourage readers to join (see pdxtroop150/troop150-website#9, still in development).
* Iselin began working on a page to catalog the current merit badge counselors among our troop leaders.

It took us a bit of effort to learn how to create a new page. At first we were able to make a new entry for the page in the menu at the top of the site, but when users navigated to the page it couldn't be found. Eventually we figured out how to make it all work.

Stuart helpfully created a new [HowTo.md](HowTo.md) file to document our learnings on how to update the favicon and how to create new pages.

Chase reviewed each of the PRs, merging Stuarts PRs with some small fixes since he'll be out for many weeks. We'll continue working on Elliot's PR for the history page and Iselin's work-in-progress merit badge counselors page in the next meeting.
